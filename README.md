# PortfolioThreeJS
Just messing around and exploring with Three.js VR environments.

Implements two super simple three degree of freedom VR environments, one meant to represent a planetary system (contact page) and the other, random revolving shapes (Landing page). 
Placed above these environments is a version of my Portfolio.
